# movies-bdd-ddd

This app is a proof of concept using Domain driven design, Behavior driven development and overall Test driven development

It consists of 3 main modules : 

- Domain : all DTOs, services, interfaces for interactions with repository and business implementations as well as unit tests for those services

- Repository : database, database configuration, repositories for interacting with the database and implementing the domain repository interface

- App : application main class, configuration, eventual properties, ReST controllers and behavior testing


## Roadmap 

[X] Implement a first BDD test using cucumber, like creating a movie

[ ] Implement the case where this test works by implementing through domain and repository
